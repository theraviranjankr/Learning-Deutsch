# RAVIRANJAN KUMAR UNSTOPPABLE - Daily Task Management Website

This is a **daily task management website** designed to help you keep track of your learning activities, especially focused on German language learning. It features checkboxes for each task and visually indicates whether a task has been missed or completed. The website uses the colors of the **German flag (black, red, and yellow)** for the design and helps manage alternating daily tasks with built-in notifications for missed tasks.

## Features
- **Task Tracking**: Allows you to track daily learning activities like:
  - German Lecture
  - 30 Wortschatz (Vocabulary)
  - Lesen (Reading)
  - Hören (Listening)
  - Sprechen (Speaking)
  - Schreiben (Writing)
  - Mathematik
  - C Test
  - Zeitung (Newspaper)
  
- **Alternate Task Setup**: On alternating days, tasks like Lesen and Hören are swapped with Sprechen and Schreiben, creating a balanced learning routine.
  
- **Notifications**: Get notified if you miss any tasks on a particular day.
  
- **Color Indicators**:
  - **Green** for completed tasks.
  - **Red** for missed tasks.

- **Auto-Save**: The website automatically saves your progress using local storage, so you won’t lose your updates even after closing the browser.
